# Operators

# Miscellaneous Output


# Miscellaneous Output
# Sometimes it may be useful to output arbitrary data from our SQL scripts. We can do this by selecting an arbitrary string and giving it a name like so:
#
#
# SELECT 'I am output!' AS 'Info';
# This gives us a table output like before.
#
#
# +----------------+
# | Info           |
# +----------------+
# | I am a output! |
# +----------------+
# 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
